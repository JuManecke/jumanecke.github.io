                    To introduce myself: I am studying Game Design with a focus on Programming at the MDH Berlin. 
                    I am currently in my 4th semester and have already worked on several projects. I am a 
                    passionate programmer, and I enjoy creating fantastic worlds.
                    <br>
                    Right now, I am searching for an internship in the field of Game Design (specifically Level Design), 
                    Programming, or Producing. This is a compulsory internship as part of my university studies. 
                    It should last for at least 4 months and take place between September 2024 and March 2025. 
                    Therefore, I created this website to showcase my work and skills.
                    <br><br>
                    (This website is still under construction and will be updated when possible. 
                    Currently, I am working on the mobile accessibility of the website, so I still recommend using 
                    wider screens or landscape mode on your phone.)
                    <br><br>
                    I am looking forward to hearing from you:

            <p class="overviewtext" style="margin:0 10% 0 10%">
                The following projects have been created in the order of their appearance, each within a timeframe 
                of 4-5 months as a significant part of the university semester. We gathered in groups of 5-12 people 
                and created these games from scratch.
                <br>
                If you want more information later on, you can click on the "Programming" chapter to find more details 
                about my role in these projects and the games themselves, which are also available on Itch.io.

                        I started as a programmer without much practical knowledge in this project and 
                        ended up doing the majority of the programming tasks. In the end, I took care 
                        of the grid system, player movement, some level design, the implementation of 
                        all animations, the power-up system, enemy movement, the death system, camera 
                        rides, the tweening of different objects, and the hydration system.
                        <br>
                        Even though I did not know much at the start, my learning curve for this project 
                        was enormous, and I am very proud of the things I have learned and achieved in 
                        this project.
                        <br>
                        With a rather big team of 10 people, some being even 4 semester higher, I would 
                        have hoped to get more guidance from 
                        them, but I still ended up doing most of the background programming through hard 
                        work and dedication. But I wanted to make even more of an impact in the following 
                        projects by taking on more responsibility.

                        So, I took on more responsibility in this project and ended up doing the 
                        majority of the programming tasks, while also managing the technical side of this 
                        game as the lead programmer. I took care of all the mini-games/riddles, the sound 
                        system, some level design (especially the early block-outs of the levels), the 
                        implementation of all animations, the rewind system, the shader management, 
                        movement for mouse and keyboard, the door system, the tween animations, the death 
                        system, the first dialogue system, and of course, the creation of builds and the 
                        management of project settings.
                        <br>
                        As a technical lead, I also took care of the version control (Perforce) and tried to 
                        keep the project organized and clean.
                        <br>
                        Since we were only a small team of 6 people, I ended up doing a lot of different 
                        tasks and therefore did most of the programming for this project.

                        This is our current project, and I am the producer and lead programmer of this game. 
                        I am also taking care of the sound system and level design. As I wanted to improve at 
                        introducing new people to our university projects, I spend a lot of time explaining the 
                        basics of programming to newcomers.
                        <br>
                        I manage the team meetings and the organization of the project. I am also responsible 
                        for version control (Perforce) and project settings.
                        <br>
                        As we are a team of 8 people, there is plenty of work to oversee and many people to 
                        support and guide. I am looking forward to the final product and the things I will 
                        learn in this project.

            <h3>About me in a Team:</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="overviewtext" style="margin:0 10% 0 10%">
                During my time at the university, I have worked on several major projects, starting 
                as a member of the programming team and gradually taking on more tasks and 
                responsibilities. I have explored various roles, including producer, sound designer, 
                level designer, game designer, and programming lead. Through hard work and dedication, 
                I have learned a lot about the different aspects of game development, and I am looking 
                forward to learning much more in the future.
                <br>
                My background in teaching has equipped me to lead less experienced team members effectively 
                and to listen to various ideas and suggestions within a team. Interacting with all kinds of 
                people is one of my strengths, and I am confident that my relentless effort and commitment 
                make me a valuable part of any team.
                <br>
                As I am seeking a compulsory internship, I am eager to expand my knowledge of the game 
                development process and to enhance my skills as a game designer and programmer. I am good at 
                adapting to new situations and learning new things quickly, therefore I am confident that I 
                could also contribute effectively to your team.
                <br><br>
                I am looking forward to hearing from you:

            For presenting my work to you, I learned a bit of HTML and CSS and created this website on my own.
            I also learned a bit of JavaScript and Jquery to make this website more interactive.
            <br><br>
            The following Projects have been made in the order of their appearance.
            Therefore my skills as a programmer have grown with each project and the more
            advanced code is in the later examples i provided.

                    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                    <p class="video-description">
                        Here you can see a little bit of Gameplay of the game as an introduction.
                        As you can see, the game is a 3D-Platformer with a lot of different mechanics.
                        The whole game was meant to be played on mobile devises and therefore the
                        controls are very simple and easy to understand.

                    <h3>Power-Ups</h3>
                    <p class="video-description">
                        In the game, you can collect different power-ups that help you to get 
                        through the levels. These are for example a speed-boost on an skateboard,
                        a water-bottle to maintain hydration, a shield to protect you from enemies,
                        a bubble for a short dehydration-stopper and a bottle of beer to get a bit
                        hydration, but also to get a bit drunk, which means random movements for a
                        short period of time. I wrote most of the logic for these power-ups.

                    <p class="video-description">
                        If you get eaten by the enemies, dehydrated too much or fall off the map,
                        you will see one of these death-animations. I wrote the logic for the
                        death-system and the animations for the player-character using tweening.

                        the end of each level, there is a small sequence. I wrote the logic for
                        the camera-rides and the animations for the camera using tweening.

                            The biggest Task for me in this project was the implementation of the grid-system.
                            It was hard to find a way to make the grid work and interact with the player.
                            From a first prototype to the final version, the grid was a big part of my work.

                            Later on, they were hidden and buildings were placed on top of them.

                        The maps consisted of a lot of different grid-blocks. 
                        They were for example normal-blocks, water-blocks, fire-blocks,
                        air-blocks, and all kinds of blocking-blocks. The player had to
                        find a way through the maps by using the different abilities of
                        the blocks to get to the goal-blocks at the end of the level.

                            The final levels only kept the grid-structure as a artistic base
                            for the level-design, but the grid-blocks itself weren't visible
                            anymore.

                            As I was very unexperienced in programming, the code for the grid
                            was hardcoded into the script, without using easier ways to implement
                            the grid. This was a big hassle, as the grid was very hard to change
                            for someone that didnt wrote the code. Only me and the project-leader
                            actually were able to read the grid-level-code and understand it.
                            As it consisted only of numbers from 0-9, it needed a bit of fantasy to 
                            see the level while reading the code.

                    by using simple invisible walls, but also by using the nav-meshes to restrict

                    <h3>Door-system</h3>
                    <p class="video-description">
                      As we had the restriction for this project to have a random-factor involved,
                        we decided to let the player enter random rooms in the mansion whenever he 
                        enters a door. I implemented a door-system that spawns the player at the
                        correct position in a random room, depending on the door he entered. This 
                        was the first prototype to this mechanic.

                    <p class="video-description">
                      As part of an exam for graphical programming, I implemented a fullscreen-shader
                        that tells the player, that he gets reseted in time. Writing a shader in unity,
                        without using the nodesystem, is actually awful and i would not like to do it again.

                        is a fan of puzzles like this, there is always little cheat to solve it,
                        so the player can continue with the game.

                    <p class="video-description">
                      We wanted to have a little physics-based puzzle in the game, so I
                        had the idea of a circuit-puzzle. The player has to connect the
                        correct lamps at the right spots for them to light up. If a lamp
                        is at the wrong spot, it will have a different lumen-value and
                        therefore indicates, that it is at the wrong spot.

                  This is the most recent game I participate in as a Programmer. But as I
                    have also a lot of other tasks, I am not the one with the most
                    programming-work in this project. But I am responsible for the
                    level-connections and the implementation of sound and music.
                    I try to help the unexpirienced programmers with their problems and the
                    engine itself. As i also keep track of the version-control, I am more
                    of an overseer this time.<br>
                    The restriction for this game was, that it had to be playable by controller.

                      This game is supposed to be a 3D-Jump'n'Run with some influences
                        of an action-adventure. The player has to fight his way through
                        the levels and solve some puzzles to get to the end of the game.
                        The first levels are more of an introduction to the game-mechanics
                        and the world itself.

                    Implementing 3D Sound and Music was also a challenge, as the sound
                    is interfering with other sound-sources in the game.

                  As I always wanted to create a Tower-defense-game I started to work on
                    one in my free time. When I had to implement unit-tests for an exam,
                    I used the game as a base for the tests.<br>
                    But I even started using unreal before I entered the university, so I
                    wanted to show my first creation. It took a way too long time to get 
                    to this point, but I am still proud of it as i learned everything in 
                    my free time and without any tutor.

                      The game is quite simple, as there is a path where the enemies are
                        walking on. The player has to place towers on the side of the path
                        to kill the enemies before they reach the end of the path. I did
                        achieve a quite decent drag'n'drop system for the towers and even
                        created the first assets on my own.

                            My first time using unit-tests was actually not that hard, as I
                            already had a good understanding of the game. I implemented a
                            test for the projectile-logic, the enemy-destruction and the 
                            tower-placement.

                        jump'n'run part in the level, where the player has to jump over
                        some obstacles to reach the goal. It is not much, but I am proud of
                        what i achived, as i really love the environment I created.

    Light green murloc-skin, Big yellow eyes, Red finns, Orange hands and feet, Big winning smile
    Big blue shorts, turquoise bikinitop, shoulder bag, big explorer hat, fishing net over the shoulder/ behind the back which can be used as a slingshot
    
    Personality/Traits:	
    •	Curious, ambitious, traumatized, pacifistic
    •	can breathe under water
    •	can talk to animals of the nexus
    
    Skills and Abilities:	
    •	Deep understanding of interdimensional travel and the mechanics of the Nexus
    •	Proficient in wilderness survival techniques
    •	Trained in ranged weaponry
    
    Background:
    She grew up in the Nexus in the Azure Abyss. 
    
    When Alva was 12, the nexus gateway opened, a big electric shockwave hit the ocean, causing most Murlocs to die in it. This got called the Nexus-Collapse, as nearly all sea-creatures vanished from the Nexus that day.
    
    Alva was visiting a friendly seagull (Mrs. Mine) at the beach at that time. When Alva forgot the guest gift for her – some clams – her family went back into the ocean of the Azure Abyss to get them. But then the Nexus-shockwave hit causing death and destruction. She had to see all her dead family-members and friends floating to the surface of the water, which haunts her till today. 
    
    After that, she was found by the 16-year-old Elena who stepped out of the Nexus-Portal that opened there at the beach. Being comforted by Elena, Alva developed a deep friendship and acknowledged her as her Mentor. Elena herself was shocked by the impact the Nexus-gateway-opening had and created the Overseer-AI as a safety mechanism so no one could interfere with the nexus-ecosystem with such an impact again. Alva helped her with that and was the most critical influence to make the AI the true new guardian of the nexus. 
    
    After Alva was happy with the result of the Overseer, she couldn’t stand to stay in the Nexus anymore, with the memories of her dead family and friends. She wanted a fresh start in the human world, therefore traveled through the Nexus-Gateway and explored the secrets of the human earth for several years. 
    
    When she got a letter from Elena to join her crew again, Alva left the earth and reentered the Nexus to help her friend and mentor out. 
    
    Internal Conflict:	
    Still traumatized by the Nexus-Collapse, she struggles with her bad memories, causing her to freeze and  getting flashbacks, when she gets to see violence or corpses.
    She sees some fault for the death of her family in herself, as she forgot the clams that were a gift for Mrs. Mine, causing them to be in the water when the Nexus-Collapse happened. She struggles with the idea of having caused their deaths.
    Is seen as the last Murloc of the Nexus and therefore has a lot of weight on her shoulders as a representative for her whole race. Struggles filling those large shoes.
    Tries to bring peace and safety to the Nexus but knows that a physical conflict might not be avoidable. But nonetheless she tries to save as many lives as possible.
    
    External conflict:	
    Alexis must navigate through hostile landscapes, confront perilous threats, and restore order to the Nexus, confronting external dangers that test her resolve and resourcefulness.
    
    Character Development throughout the game:	
    Alva faces her inner trauma and realizes that she was a kid and wasn’t in fault with her families’ deaths.
    As Alva faces the Nexus again after a very long time being away from it, many people of the Nexus thought that even the last Murloc have died meanwhile as they haven’t seen one in an eternity. But as Alva explores the world, she sees that she can bring happiness and hope to the people by showing that there still is a Murloc in the Nexus which weakens the weight on her shoulder with each smile she causes.
    As Alva gets involved in some conflicts with the Ascendants, she realizes that they were mind-tricked into their faith and can be saved by talking, convincing, and showing strength without using cruelty to solve the conflict. 
    
    Motivation:
    Alexis feels a profound sense of responsibility towards the Nexus and its inhabitants, viewing herself as a guardian tasked with preserving its sanctity and safeguarding its future. She is willing to risk everything to defend the Nexus from external threats and ensure its survival for generations to come.

    She wears red-orange chain-armor with leather-improvements and big glowing shoulder-pats. Dressed in a black cloak and with a shield that inhabits a skull on her arm.  
    She wields a golden weapon, an old elven artifact, the “Mace of Minds”.

    -	Egoistic
    -	Psychopathic
    -	full of hatred

    Skills and Abilities:	
    -	can cast elven-magic of the inner circle
    -	can mind-trick with her mace
    -	deep understanding of the Nexus and its Powers
    
    Background:	
    Rosa Teelu grew up in the Nexus in the Sandswept Expanse as a kid of the most high-ranked elves in the Nexus. She was supposed to become a magical guardian of the inner circle to protect the most important artifacts amongst the treasures of the desert. That’s why she never got used to anything outside of the inner circles-sanctuaries and didn’t even see much of the desert, meaning she kept being pale from the lack of sunlight. 
    
    When she was 14, the Nexus-Collapse happened and the humans entered the nexus, bringing destruction and chaos at first. After the elves took their time, as they always do, to get to an opinion about the new people of the Nexus, the inner circle, which her parents were a part of, decided to stop any intruders of the nexus by starting a big ritual to close the nexus-gateway. As this took some years already, the Overseer was finished when the inner circle finally decided to hold this ritual. As the Overseer was programmed, any interference or change of the Nexus-Gateway was seen as dangerous, so therefore the Overseer interrupted the inner circle and eliminated the threat by vaporizing all elves of the circle. Souleater witnessed that, but no one believed the word of a kid.
    
    As no elf of the inner circle got seen again by the others, this event got known as “The Big Vanish”, and the other elves of the outer circle continued to safeguard the secrets and treasures of the Sandswept Expanse.
    
    Rosa Teelu was left alone as an outcast, with no family and friends, not welcomed and only being tolerated by the other elves. She developed a big deal of hatred for the Overseer, the humans and everyone helping them.  
    After some dark years she remembered the stories her parents told her about the magic artifacts and started searching for them. 
    
    After some time, she finally found the “Mace of Minds”, which grants her the ability to mind-trick people. With that power she started to build up the cult of the Ascendants and started to call herself an anagram of Rosa Teelu - Souleater. 
    
    Her goal is to use the magical powers of the “Heart of the Nexus”. To enter it, a member of every Main-Race is needed – an dwarf, an elf and an murloc.
    It has nearly unlimited magical power and is the source of all magic and life in the Nexus.
    
    She started to gather more and more people around her to get hints about the vanished Murlocs. When she found out that Alva, the last Murloc, is in the human world and has a friendship with Elena, she started to danger the human civilization of the nexus to pressure Elena to call Alva for help. This way Souleater would have a murloc to access the Heart of the Nexus and use its powers. 
    
    Internal Conflict:	
    Wants to reach her goal of getting her parents back without sacrificing too much of herself. Souleater has inner doubts about whether she is going too far and could still justify her actions towards her parents.
    
    External conflict:	
    Souleater must seek a Murloc to get to the Heart of the Nexus. Therefore she has to find all the hints about the humans and their allies she could get, trying to not miss out on important details.
    Then she needs to defend the Heart of the Nexus towards the enemy forces and the Overseer to get enough time to use its magical power for the rewind.
    Character Development throughout the game:	
    While at the start Souleater used the artifacts power in an inhibited way, she opens up towards its power more and more over time making her more unpredictable and more violent to reach her goal.
    
    Motivation:	
    Her goal is to use the magical powers of the “Heart of the Nexus”. She wants to go back in time to the Moment where the Nexus-Gateway wasn’t opened yet and her parents were still alive. She wants to get them back to live in the trouble-free times as a kid again, reunited with her loved parents.

        <h4>Leveldesign</h4>
        <p class="normal">
            Starting this semester, I took a deeper look into level-design. I like the subtle
            ways of guiding the player through the level and the storytelling that can be done
            through the environment alone. We started simple with lemmings and try to get a 
            feeling for the introduction to the player. Getting all the ideas and concepts
            to use in out game-project is helpful to get a good start.

        <p class="normal">
            The goal of this lemmings-level can only be reached by planning and foresight. 
            Cause the Player only has to bring one single lemming to the goal, the level is not overwhelming.

                    Starting with simple grid-based levels, 
                    i tried to get a feeling for the level-designing in my first project
                    already. As all the grid-levels had to be written by me, I was able to
                    get a good understanding of the basics - what is needed, what attracts 
                    the player and what ideas don´t work.

                    Even small Tower-defense levels can be a challenge. As the player has to

                    but the player still has to be able to kill the enemies. taking into 
                    consideration the range of the towers and the speed of the enemies, the
                    player has to be able to plan ahead.

            <p class="legals">
                In our current project, I am the producer of our team, but also Tech-lead.
                I am responsible for the organization and communication of our team and also the contact with our lecturers.
                We use Jira and Miro as our project-management tool.
                <br>
                Starting with a Project-Breakdown-Sheet, we split everything in tasks.
                This is the PBS of our current game:

                The split tasks got written into Jira:

                And the tasks got visualized in Miro, using it as a big digital whiteboard:

                But as we are a small team, and only have a limited timeframe for our project, 
                I also need to keep track of our scope.

                    with the friends i gathered over the years in this game.
                    Together we had a lot of fun, but we were also quite successful.
                    We won the division 5 cup in season 16.
                    In season 18 we won the division 5.
                    When we got into division 4 in season 19, we won its cup.
                    And in season 20 we won the division 3 and got 4th place in the cup.
